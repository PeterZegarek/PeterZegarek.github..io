                <h1>Personal Interests</h1>
                <p>Some of my personal interests include sports and video games. I also love learning, but I'll keep CS related things to the projects page!</p>
                <h4>Sports that I like to play:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Volleyball - I was a captain on my high school team, and I still love to play at least a few times a week.</li>
                    <li>Soccer - Childhood sport, I keep up with professional soccer and have been wanting to play more in my spare time.</li>
                    <li>Basketball - New to me. I've always known basketball but I've never done organized basketball of any kind and am looking to get better.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Favorite Video Games:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sonic - Ever since I was a little kid, I've been a huge Sonic fan. I play just about all of the games, and I've even gone to the Sonic Symphony live Orchestra concerts!</li>
                    <li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege - For those familiar with Sonic as well as R6, you'll know that's a pretty huge genre jump.. but I really love Siege. It's a tactical shooter and I love the strategy and coordination that it demands from players.</li>
                    <li>Persona - A new series to me, I only just started playing it recently and it's been awesome! The games are very long, but they have a super engaging gameplay loop and a great story!</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <p>I'm a current junior at Quinnipiac University studying Computer Science. I'm also in a 3+1 program, meaning that I graduate in 3 years with a bachelor's degree (in CS), and then after one more year I'll graduate with an MS (in Cybersecurity).</p>
                <h4>Some programming languages that I am comfortable with are:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java - My go-to language for just about anything.</li>
                    <li>Kotlin - I learned Kotlin for Android Development.</li>
                    <li>Python - While much less than java, I have some experience with Python.</li>
                    <li>HTML/CSS - how else would I have made this website?</li>
                    <li>Scala - Scala was the first language I was taught in my intro programming course at QU!</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Frameworks and tools I am familiar with:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jetpack Compose - I use Jetpack Compose as opposed to Views when making Android apps. I like the programmatic approach it has to making UI elements.</li>
                    <li>Git/GitHub - I am very familiar with Git and GitHub for version control. I use it for just about every project I have.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Past Work Experience:</h4>
                <p>I had an internship working at Sectra over Summer 2023. It was an amazing experience, and I learned what it was like to work for an IT firm. I learned all about their clients, and I was able to collaborate with other interns to move customers over 
                    from an old connectivity tool to a new one. This meant that we needed to first get permission, and then we remotely accessed customers machines and configured new software. We then verified that it worked and uninstalled the old
                    tool, using a script we developed in Powershell. 
                </p>
                <p>I also have experience on a research project working with a professor of mine. We are currently in the process of developing a translation app that will include ASL as one of the language options
                    and work over the phone. This way people all across the world can communicate with other people across the world from them and not need to worry about sharing a common language. I am developing this 
                    as an Android app.
                </p>
                <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to present my work (on the research project) at a regional conference, CCSCNE, and my partner and I won second place!</p>

                <h1>What got me into Computer Science?</h1>
                <p>It's actually a bit hard to say what the initial thing was that got me into CS. I was always loosely interested in the field but nothing had entirely sold me on it.
                    In high school I took AP Computer Science Principles, which was a cool class, but we didn't do much coding in there at all, which meant that I still didn't really know if CS
                    was going to be a fit for me. I toured Quinnipiac, and the CS faculty completely sold my family and I on the school. I committed here as a CS major, and then once I started taking classes,
                    things really flew away! 
                 </p>
                 <p>The more and more I learned about the field and the more projects I took on, the more interested I got.
                    Whether it was trying to speed up an algorithm from O(n^2) time to O(n) time, or re-learning how to use Java Swing every few months because I would forget, it was all so much fun!
                    I find myself wanting to continue learning more and more about CS as the days go by. Attending hackathons has also been an awesome experience. I get to try random things and spend a whole day working on them, with a chance of prizes at the end!
                    In my most recent hackathon (April 2024), my group won second place! 
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    So while there isn't really a specific catalyst that got me interested in CS, it was just the ins and outs of daily things that really made me fall in love with the field.
                    That all started during my first semester of college.
