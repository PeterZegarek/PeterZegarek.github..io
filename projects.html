        <h1>Elemental Hero</h1>
        <p>This is hands down my biggest as well as favorite project that I have so far worked on. This was a project for the SER225 class at Quinnipiac. This was a semester long project where the class
            split up into teams of 4 developers as well as one manager (a student who already took the course and was currently enrolled in a separate project management course). This project was run with the Agile/Scrum Framework in mind. 
            We had weekly stand up meetings, and we had a total of 5 sprints throughout the semester.
        </p>
        <p>I'll let the website for the game speak for itself, but in a nutshell, it's a platformer where you unlock new abilities and progress through levels until you face the final boss. This was all programmed in Java.

        <h1>Online Trivia Game</h1>
        <p>This was one of my more recent projects, being for my CSC340 Networking and Distributed Processing Class. This was also a group project, where I as well as
            two other developers worked on using the TCP and UDP protocols together to make a functional multiplayer trivia game. Our game's theme was Star Wars, and participants
            can hit a buzzer to get the opportunity to answer the question (that every player views at the same time), but only the first person to buzz gets to answer.
            Our game handles multiple use cases, including players joining / leaving mid game, buzzing constantly, cases where no one buzzes, cases where someone refuses to answer, etc.
        </p>
        <p>This project really challenged us, but it turned out to be a great game and I finished it feeling extremely confident using the TCP protocol and much more confident using UDP than before.</p>

        <h2>Future Project Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity Video Game - I've been super interested in Game Dev, and I recently purchased an online course to familiarize myself with the Unity Game Engine.
                I'd love to be able to make video games in the future and give something to the community that has given me so much throughout my life.
            </li>
            <li>Sudoku Puzzle Generator - Now I know this is very much a thing that exists. I just feel like this would be something interesting to make from scratch!
                Some motivation behind this is that my mom really likes Sudoku, and it would be cool to make something that would be super useful for her. She wouldn't have to go out
                and buy Sudoku books as often as she does.
            </li>
        </ul>
